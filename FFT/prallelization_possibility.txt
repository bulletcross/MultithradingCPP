possible parallelizations:
in prod_fourier - recursiveFFT(c) with 2 threads
in recursive FFT - filter + recursiveFFT with 2 threads and rest part serially after joining
in point_multiply - for loop can be parallelized
in recursiveFFTinv - similar to recursiveFFT
in recursiveFFTinv_wrapper - for loop can be parallelized
